CAD NOTES -- Checklist for later

- What size screws do we have access to? (Tensioning screws)
- What is thickness of belt? (Roller diameter)

- Guidewall and frame should be a little wider (1/8" maybe) for 
  block tolerance
- How do we mount the wheels lower? (Platform doesn't reach 6 in high, only 5.7)
